// UpstreamClient defines an interface for DNS upstream resolution.
// Implementations of this interface are responsible for sending DNS queries
// to an upstream server and returning the corresponding DNS response.
// The Resolve method takes a context for cancellation and timeout control,
// as well as a Question object, and returns a DNSResponse or an error.
type UpstreamClient interface {
	Resolve(ctx context.Context, query domain.Question, now time.Time) ([]domain.ResourceRecord, error)

// Blocklist defines an interface for checking whether a DNS query is blocked.
// Implementations should provide logic to determine if a given Question
// should be considered blocked, typically for filtering or security purposes.

// Cache defines the interface for a DNS resource record cache.
// It provides methods to create a new cache, store, retrieve, and delete records,
// as well as to query cache statistics and keys.
//
// Methods:
//   - New(size int): Creates a new cache with the specified size.
//   - Set(record *domain.ResourceRecord): Stores a resource record in the cache.
//   - Get(key string): Retrieves resource records by key, returning the records and a boolean indicating existence.
//   - Delete(key string): Removes a resource record from the cache by key.
//   - Len(): Returns the number of cache entries currently stored in the cache.
//   - Keys(): Returns a slice of all keys currently stored in the cache.

// DNSResponder defines an interface for handling DNS queries and generating responses.
// Implementations of this interface process DNS requests, abstracting away network protocol details.
// The HandleQuery method receives the query, client address, and context, and returns a DNS response.
type DNSResponder interface {
	// HandleQuery processes a DNS query and returns a DNS response.
	// The transport handles all network protocol details - the handler only sees domain objects.

// ZoneCache defines the interface for in-memory authoritative record storage with value-based records

	Zones() []string

	// Count returns the total number of records across all zones
	Count() int

// AliasResolver defines an interface for resolving CNAME (alias) chains within
// the authoritative zone (and eventually across upstream/cache layers). It is
// responsible for expanding an initial record set that begins with a CNAME
// into a full answer set that includes the CNAME chain plus records that
// satisfy the original query type. Implementations must enforce a maximum
// recursion depth and detect alias loops.
//
// The returned slice should contain the full ordered chain (each CNAME hop
// followed by the terminal RRset, if found). The bool indicates whether any
// alias chasing was performed. An error indicates an internal failure or a
// policy breach (e.g. depth exceeded) â€“ the caller may translate certain
// errors into DNS RCODEs (e.g. SERVFAIL).
type AliasResolver interface {
	// Chase expands an initial answer set that begins with a CNAME into the
	// full ordered chain (CNAME hops + terminal RRset). It returns the expanded
	// slice (or the original slice if no chasing was required) and an error for
	// policy breaches (loop/depth) or internal failures. Implementations handle
	// their own fast path internally so callers can always invoke Chase.
	Chase(query domain.Question, initial []domain.ResourceRecord) ([]domain.ResourceRecord, error)
